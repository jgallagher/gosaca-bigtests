gosaca-bigtests
===============

Repository containing large corpus files for testing
[gosaca](https://github.com/jgallagher/gosaca).

The files in the large\_corpus directory are from [Manzini's Large Corpus](http://people.unipmn.it/manzini/lightweight/corpus/).

The files in the gauntlet\_corpus directory are from Maniscalco's Gauntlet Corpus. The original path to this corpus was http://www.michael-maniscalco.com/testset/gauntlet/, but last time I looked on that website I couldn't find them. They are available from a mirror at [compressionratings.com](http://compressionratings.com/download.html#gauntlet).
